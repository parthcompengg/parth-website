# Intro

I am a Biocomputing Software Engineer with strong analytical and technical skills. I work with scientist and researchers to understand experimental process and develop software applications that meet their needs. I am particularly interested in projects that touch health and safety, imaging, social impact, and education. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

# Currently

At SARL, I merge software engineering with scientific exploration, creating secure bio-computing applications. My work ensures data integrity, supporting researchers in their quest for groundbreaking discoveries.

# Some history

- At 17, I finished my High school study and moved away from my home to pursue my bachelor's degree from North Maharashtra University, which was  around 300 miles away.
- At 21, I got my undergrad degree in Computer Science and my passion for Software Engineering began.
- At 22, I started my first job as Software Engineer at Kreative-Apps where I created my first mobile web app.

# Fun facts

- I love debugging code as much as I love hiking; both activities refresh my mind and solve puzzles in unique settings.
- I often draw parallels between cooking and coding, believing that creating a great dish and developing effective software both require a blend of creativity, precision, and balance.
